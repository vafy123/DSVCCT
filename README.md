# DSVCCT - DS Virtual Console Conversion Tool

This is a simple application that lets you transfer your saves of any Nintendo DS game, even injected ones, between Wii U and (3)DS quickly and effectively.

## What you need

The following "base files" are requied:

* A save from your Wii U for each game you wish to transfer, exported with SaveMii.
	* Make sure you have a proper in-game save before exporting. A save state or suspension point is not sufficient.

* A copy of your DS game.
	* It has to be the same as the one you're using on your (3)DS, with the same file name.

## How to use

First of all, you need to add some games, which can be done by pressing the `Add game` button. After naming your game and specifying the location of the game's base files, you'll be able to select files for conversion. When converting from Wii U, select the .save file from your SaveMii export and choose the desired location of the .sav file that you can use on your (3)DS. When converting from (3)DS, you'll need to select a .sav file and specify a SaveMii slot. The conversion will result in a folder named the slot number you chose. Make sure to wipe your save data of the game in SaveMii before importing your converted save, otherwise the suspension point of your last session will be loaded.

The base files are required for reference, but as long as you have them correctly specified, you can convert any save. You can even select files straight from your SD card.
